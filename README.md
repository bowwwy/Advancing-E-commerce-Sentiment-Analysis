# E-commerce-Sentiment-Analysis

The intended system is a cutting-edge research project spearheaded by Computer Science students Princess Rainbow Angeles, Ryan Caabay, and Aaron Lasala. Focused on advancing E-Commerce Sentiment Analysis, the system employs a sophisticated combination of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Stochastic Gradient Boosting Ensembles (SGB). Through a systematic approach, the team addresses challenges in the e-commerce industry, such as competition and customer satisfaction, by leveraging valuable customer reviews. The proposed system holds significance for technological advancement in sentiment analysis and contributes novel insights to the field of Data Science.
