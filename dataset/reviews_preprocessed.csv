19,19,4,McCanns Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it There is no escaping the fact however that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation Still the McCanns is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal Its even better than the organic allnatural brands I have tried All the varieties in the McCanns variety pack taste good It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issuebr br McCanns use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff One thing I do not like though is McCanns use of thickeners Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum But this is a convenience product Maybe the guar gum is why after sitting in the bowl a while the instant McCanns becomes too thick and gluey,0.2205,0.5603333333333332,0.5476048588752747,2
13,13,4,This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup so not only does it have a better sweetness but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you Great on a cold morning when you dont have time to make McCanns Steel Cut Oats The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too Plus they dont require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart,0.3661538461538462,0.5333530571992109,0.9468226432800293,2

0,0,5,McCanns makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour to the sloth addled instant which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes Its all good thats for sure and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regularbr This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCanns and other wellknown oatmeals What I personally like about McCanns is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America The Apples Cinnamon though tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twentyseven seconds so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to usebr The only bad thing if you can consider it a bad thing about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so youll end up with six tencount boxes This is good if you have a whole family of oatmealeaters but if youre a single person alone well love oatmeal,0.0674769071508202,0.5394078144078143,0.8302693367004395,2

4,4,5,I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat and this is an excellent food That is also according to my holistic veterinarian They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step which is very important to me The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select,0.5399999999999999,0.5833333333333334,0.9669303297996521,2
2,2,5,This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight It stopped her problems She doesnt eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price It aids in digestion since theok sorrysmells are gone if ya know what I mean Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food,0.09027777777777778,0.439484126984127,0.6262156367301941,2

0,0,5,My holistic vet recommended this along with a few other brands We tried them all but my cats prefer this especially the sardine version The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear AND and I dont want to be rude so Ill say this as delicately as I can their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores which is a definite plus for me The health benefits are so obvious I highly recommend Holistic Select,0.03147058823529412,0.5185294117647059,0.9208554029464722,2

2,2,5,This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts I am about to make one for a pie auction at church after a friend requested that something strawberry should be offered You can make the most amazing and relatively healthy fruit tarts by baking a base layering it with uncooked fresh sliced fruit then pouring over the madeup contents of one of these packets They harden up at room temperature hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through Ive also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes to hold a fruit topping in place Personally I do not like cheesecake too rich for me but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous I will admit To do this slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while its still in the springform pan Pour on the glaze let it set up and then remove the springform Youll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake Cherries strawberries or sliced mangos are nice but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cakebr br I use a base of sponge cake baked in a shallow form but other bases can be pate sucre a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie that works well in those fluted straightsided forms You can also make minitarts in a muffin pan prebaking each mold with a layer of pie crust even commercial crust works though again I prefer pate sucre it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb Just blindbake the muffin tins lined with pate then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits berries are great and pour over the glaze Some people put a layer of creme patisserie which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour below the fruit and I happen to think these taste bestbr br If you get into baking this glaze is a musthave on the shelf The ingredients are vegan tapioca starch carrageenan dextrose cream of tartar locust bean gum so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake you can use this on top as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base,0.18118279569892473,0.5647849462365592,0.8261638283729553,2

20,27,1,I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to They were all uniform whitish yellow in color flavor was way off the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed So I emailed Kettle with the following What Happened I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste It tastes cheaper I dont know how else to put it I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product Did I just get a weird batch I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering I did receive a reply Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand Chips It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections and we apologizeOur potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in colorbut our chips should still taste greatThanks for providing us with the best before code from the bag This really helps when passing on your comments to our staffbr We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand flavors or nut butters believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase In case you buy this product again we suggest avoiding the same best before date if you still have it in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same timebr Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks Please let me know if I can be of any more help Well the next bag was good Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the bad bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle Acquire company with high quality brand recognition sell product to mass merchants lower qualitycost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same,0.13466666666666666,0.4613086419753086,0.6432050466537476,2

2,2,1,I opened the can and immediately became concerned when I saw what looked like dried white crust rather than fluffy frosting The package recommended stirring before use so I gave that a try and under the crust was an indescribable gelatinous goo The best I can equate it to is a white version of the blue goop the mother serves for dinner in Better of Dead no raisins in it thoughbr I tried to stir it together and the end result was gelatinous goo with white crusties in it When lifting the knife to spread it long strings on goo trailed from my knifebr I opted for making my own frosting instead very easy A little Sprectrum palm shortening a lot of powdered sugar a tiny splash of vanilla a tiny bit of salt and rice milk as needed for consistency beat for 5 minutes and I had the fluffy butter cream frosting I thought Id get from Cherrybrookbr br I wonder if our can was overheated in the store whole foods or somethingbr Ive read positive reviews of their frosting mix so maybe Ill try that next time,0.07765530303030303,0.42727272727272736,0.5698725581169128,0

2,2,5,Im not sure how you review something thats as subjective as taste but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker youll like this it doesnt taste exactly like either of those but thats the closest analogy for me The sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind dipped in chocolate with one end left just normal cracker to you dont get your fingers covered in chocolate while eatingbr br Heres some of the nitty gritty details each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks The packets themselves are really cleverly designed with a little slit cut in the folded part you just grab both sides and pull and it opens up the package without any hassle gotta love Japanese product design Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbingside of the stick is right at the topbr br Each of the packets has 210 calories 90 from fat and about 80mg of sodium so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option It does contain milk wheat soybeans and sheanut so if any of these are an issue for you then youll want to pass It also says on the packaging that the facility theyre manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts the product doesnt use either of them but the disclosure is nice if youre particularly sensitive to eitherbr br Overall a great snack at a great price the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets so thats quite a few snacks One note if you live in a hot climate dont order them in the summer because they will melt together in shipping Duh ,0.20189794773128109,0.5614050558495002,0.6503427028656006,1

1,1,5,I bought these back in January and never got around to reviewing them I had heard many people rave about a Japanese snack called Pocky so I figured I would try it out Just like the description states its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate I wouldnt say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess well as long as the chocolate doesnt melt Anyways in case anyone is wondering I ordered from a seller named Very asia amazoncomgphelpsellerataglancehtmlieUTF8isAmazonFulfilled0orderID10370719445595443marketplaceSeller1sellerA3JW437I54SEI1 I believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me maybe it had to be imported but when it did it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever Im definitely considering restocking on this in the future if I cant find a local storebr br EDIT Oct 11 2012br br Inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchasebr br So I decided to restock after I couldnt fight the craving anymore Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime What I received was not the picture shown on the front page 2 per pack japanese pocky it was a 1 per pack pockyish thing from Thailand In my opinion the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouthbr br Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a not eat everything at once and b avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items I can honestly say that I wont be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much I wont change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3 The taste isnt terrible but its definitely not to my liking If possible I will be uploading some pictures of what I received,0.02125,0.4642857142857143,0.5385738611221313,1

1,1,5,Pocky is just plain fun to eat I discovered these snacks at an anime convention though Id heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them They are very very slim sticks of biscuity stuff the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels that have a charming tiny popping crispness The chocolate flavor a nice nonbitter nondark generically pleasing chocotaste seems to be the most popular given how fast they sell out at cons but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream Very nicebr br This is by no means a health food its in the same category as a cookie its got fat and sugar and nonhealthful ingredients But hey its junk food We all know its supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet Unless youre really prone to bingeeating or cant stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat 3 of them saturated I wouldnt recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes In fact just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effectbr br If you love the flavor of coconutchocolate together like Almond Joy try the coconut chocolate ones Theyre really so good oh man Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout caramel delights cookies which are in turn similar to the old Yes Yes cookies from the seventies or sobr br Anyway if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those sticklooking treats or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats this is what they were eating Fun treatsbr br However with this crazy hot summer Id recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until falls cooler weather You might get a sticky clumped mess of Pocky sticks in this deep summer weather Look for local stores that specialize in Japanese anime or manga and theyll likely carry Japanese snacks like these In South Florida Tates Comics has them in a variety of flavorsand FRESH and NOT MELTED,0.14381042568542568,0.4104779942279942,0.7886984944343567,2

0,0,4,For those looking for a more exotic tea drinking experience and who like white Jasmine tea Numis Flower Jewel is worth a look About the size of a gumball these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower They are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this teabr br Decorative does not mean tasteless As a white tea the flavor is mild but rich and soothing The jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea I have had stronger jasmine teas but this one is quite balanced and tasty I used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade The white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and dont get bitter if seeped for long periodsbr br I must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels Pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact Some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf Better packaging might solve thisbr br If you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells or are entertaining and want a conversation piece then Numi Tea Flower Jewel should be on your short list,0.2176838235294118,0.47281862745098036,0.7690572142601013,2

1,2,2,These are good sunflower seeds at a good price if you prefer the unsalted variety which can be hard to findbr br One thing to keep in mind though is the expiration or best by date For example if you order these in April and the batch you receive has a June use by date it may be a stretch to consume the 300 bags before the seeds start going rancid on you Since theyre roasted in oil and unsalted these seeds may spoil more readily than the salted variety even if refrigerated upon receiptbr br Amazon doesnt seem to specify use by dates for the food products they sell so its a gamble for the purchaser Im assuming that Amazon wont ship stuff that has expired but they probably ship out the oldest stock first and the use by date on the item may not be what you would select if you had a choice,0.42870370370370364,0.5972222222222221,0.5260950922966003,1
